## About the Vaquita

The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is the world's smallest cetacean and most endangered marine mammal. Found only in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico, fewer than 10 individuals remain in the wild. Their primary threat is entanglement in illegal fishing nets set for other species.
